This program is a simple python web scraper. Every 8 hours, it will iterate through a list of product URLs (in this case product pages for trading cards) and 
will send an email for each product that drops below a certain price, which the program gets from the html on the site. I wrote this program to use with a 
group of friends for a trading card game we all play, since the prices for cards tend to fluctuate often, so it's been really useful in a real life setting.
